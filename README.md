Notation:

- `***` I know it well, no additional studying would be needed (studied in detail / used in real projects recently)
- `**` Some studying/refreshing may be needed (studied it / used in real projects a while ago / have some proof-of-concepts, etc)
- `*` Studying would be needed (I know _why_ and _when_ it should be used, but not much about _how_)
- `PN` TODO to study more with prio N
