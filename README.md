# Andrius B. (WIP)

I am a software developer based in Vilnius, Lithuania. I am working in software development since 2005.

This page is a summary of what technologies and practices I am familiar with and my notes in various form: cheatsheets, bookmarks, project-starter-templates, proof-of-concepts, etc.

## Notation:

Knowledge level:

- `***` I know it well, no additional studying would be needed (studied in detail / used in real projects recently)
- `**` Some studying/refreshing may be needed (studied it / used in real projects a while ago / have some proof-of-concepts, etc)
- `*` Studying would be needed (I know _why_ and _when_ it should be used, but not much about _how_)

Other:

- `PN` TODO to study more with prio N
