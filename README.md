# Andrius B. technical profile

I am Andrius - software developer based in Vilnius, Lithuania, working in softare development since 2005.

This repo is my technical profile - things I have learned and things I still need to learn. It also contains my technical notes in various form: bookmarks, cheetsheets, proof of concepts, etc.

Knowledge levels notation, used in this page:

- `***` I know it well, no additional studying would be needed (studied in detail / used in real projects recently)
- `**_` Some studying/refreshing would be needed (studied it / used in real projects a while ago / have proof-of-concept)
- `*__` Studying would be needed (I know "why" and "when" it should be used, but not much about "how")
